    "# Color extraction from images with Lithops4Ray\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we explain how to use Lithops4Ray to extract colors and [HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) color range from the images persisted in the IBM Cloud Oject Storage. To experiment with this tutorial, you can use any public image dataset and upload it to your bucket in IBM Cloud Object Storage. For example follow [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) to download images. We also provide upload [script](https://github.com/project-codeflare/data-integration/blob/main/scripts/upload_to_ibm_cos.py) that can be used to upload local images to the IBM Cloud Object Storage \n",

    "Now let's tie all together with a main method. By using Lithops allows us to remove all the boiler plate code required to list data from the object storage. It also inspects the data source by using the internal Lithops data partitioner and creates a lazy execution plan, where each entry maps an \"extract_color\" function to a single image. Moreover, Lithops creates a single authentication token that is used by all the tasks, instead of letting each task perform authentication. The parallelism is controlled by Ray and once Ray task is executed, it will call Lithops to execute the extract_color function directly in the context of the calling task. Thus, by using Lithops, we can allow code to access object storage data, without requiring additional coding effort from the user."
